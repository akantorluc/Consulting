Assumption 1: Linear relationships
Plots of responses vs explanatory vars
Responses I am looking at:
*Didn't look at plot yet

waterDepth ~ year
Typha ~ trmt_above + trmt_below + trmt_Mow
Typha ~ year
potber ~ Typha
potber ~ year
utrmin ~ Typha
utrmin ~ year
utrvul ~ Typha
utrvul ~ year
potber ~ waterDepth
utrmin ~ waterDepth
utrvul ~ waterDepth

```{r}

plot(year, waterDepth) # Water depth in 2011 differs from water depth in 2012 and 2013
# Not necessarily linear
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ggplot(data = Consult) + (mapping = aes(x = trmt, y = Typha)) + geom_col() # Cutting above, below, or mowing definitely has an effect on the Typha

plot(year, Typha) # 2012 and 2013 have less Typha than 2011

plot(Typha, potber)
pot_no_zero <- lapply(potber,function(x) x[x!=0])
plot(Typha, pot_no_zero) # Could be exponentially distibuted with a large lambda, but there are zeros so this won't work. Could be polynomial then. 


plot(year, potber) # Doesn't look like year has much of an effect

plot(Typha, utrmin) # Definitely a decrease in utrmin as Typha increases. Maybe linear. 

plot(year, utrmin) # 2011 is only year with varying levels

plot(Typha, utrvul) # Lots of dispersion, no clear trend

plot(year, utrvul) # Year definietly has an effect on utrvul

plot(waterDepth, potber) # No clear pattern

plot(waterDepth, utrmin) # No clear pattern

plot(waterDepth, utrvul) # more utrvul as waterDepth increases. Could definitely have a linear relationship. 

```
Assumption 2: Normally distributed responses
